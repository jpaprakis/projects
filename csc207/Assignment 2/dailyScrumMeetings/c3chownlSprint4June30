This one was the one I had to delete because of computer problems 

a) What did I work on last time? 
-I worked on the mv method. and finished it 


b) What do I plan to work on now?  
-work on switching all the coding regarding Arrays to arraylist 
-change cp method to do the same (work with arraylist)

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
-Initially when switching the mv and cp idea to polymorphism, for some reason my brain wasn't 
understanding the idea. I felt that the two methods should be related, so I though that cp and mv 
would be the similar. What I had to understand (with the help of Juli) Is the idea of the methods mv and cp 
taking in type FileSystem (which could be rather a type File or Directory). Essentially mv and cp are 
implemented differently, and they need to be able to work with both directories and files.
That is why polymorphism helps. 
There is also the idea of trees. I understand why we are designing the FileSystem in a tree format. 
I just need to be refreshed with the whole idea of when to call parent.children.  or just children. 
What exactly we are calling, and I think once we start fully implementing our test cases it will 
be clearer!
