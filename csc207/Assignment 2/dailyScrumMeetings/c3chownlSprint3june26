This one was the one I had to delete because of computer problems 

a) What did I work on last time? 
-mv method 


b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	--I thought the mv method was a lot easier than what it was so I have to work on that now 

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
--well mainly syntax. Getting used to working with classes 
--and to understand how to fully design something in a class system
