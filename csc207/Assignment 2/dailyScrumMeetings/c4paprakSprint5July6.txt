a) What did I work on last time? 
	-did most of the JUnit testing for the project
	-fixed mv and cp so they work
	-fixed mkdir since there was an error creating double directories
	-fixed part of the print class so that it properly returns output
	
b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	-figure out how to get mv and cp to create new files if the second file in the command argument does not currently exist
	-check all possible erroneous inputs for all commands and ensure we catch them all
	
c) Am I blocked on anything?  
	-the checkPath method was broken earlier today - not sure if it got fixed
