a) What did I work on last time? 
	- Work on checking all input is valid and creating exceptions if not.

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	-Add testing for exceptions
	-Check the style of our code to make sure everything is consistent

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
    -I don't entirely know how to test the exceptions, I tried for a while
    but it's hard for me to grasp
