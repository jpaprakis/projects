What did I do last time?
	- Reformatted parsing of paths
	- Completed mkdir command

What do I plan to do now?
	- Completed echo STRING [> OUTFILE] command
	- Completed echo STRING >> OUTFILE command
	- Completed cat command
	- Completed ls command
	- Completed cd command

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Need to implement proper error messages
	- Need to complete mv, cp, and man commands!
