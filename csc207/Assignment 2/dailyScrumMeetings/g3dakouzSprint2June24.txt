What did I do last time?
	- Restructured some directory methods
	- Added comments to several functions

What do I plan to do now?
	- Created fileInDirectory method in Directory
	- Created fileNameToObject method in Directory
	- Created several method outlines for echo >, echo >>, and cat in AllCommands

Am I blocked on anything?
	- I need a way to keep track of the working directory and use it in AllCommands
	- Need to work with Julianna today to create some ls commands
