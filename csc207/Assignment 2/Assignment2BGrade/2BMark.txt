==== Java Style ==== 

Warning:
    Not following the 80character column width limit in three places:
	driver/File.java : 2 lines
	test/TestingFile.java : 1 line


==== Design ==== [-1.5]

public instance variables instead of setters and getters -.5 
	public vars Directory.workingDirectory and Directory.root are used directly
	throughout the project
	
not a good breakdown of classes and methods (everything static; no ability
to, for example, make two shells that coexist; not extensible) -.5
	public vars Directory.workingDirectory and Directory.root are also declared
	as static. The main method is designed such that there is no way to have two 
	coexisting shells (and filesystems)
	
long methods exist (more than roughly 30 lines from brace to brace) -.5
	Some monster methods such as Input.enteredCommand() and
	Directory.makeDirToRemoveList() exist

==== Javadoc ==== [-1]

A lot of missing javadoc, esp. on classes and vars:
