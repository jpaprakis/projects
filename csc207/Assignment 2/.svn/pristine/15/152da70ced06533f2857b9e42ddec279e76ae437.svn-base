This one was the one I had to delete because of computer problems 

a) What did I work on last time? 
-work on switching all the coding regarding Arrays to arraylist 
-change cp method to do the same (work with arraylist)


b) What do I plan to work on now?  
-making man method. Jacob will be populating the dictionary
-testing 


c) Am I blocked on anything?  
---right now not so much, switching everything to array lists was straight forward, I think we 
might run into some difficulty when testing some things.
