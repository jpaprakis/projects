a) What did I work on last time? 
	-Worked on Initial Product backlog with team
	-Worked on Sprint 1 backlog with team

b) What do I plan to work on now?  
	-Work on methods to delete files and delete directories

c) Am I blocked on anything?  
	-CDF computers are giving me trouble, I'm not sure why but I can't run any
	code on them, so until I figure this problem out I can't test anything. 
	Email was sent to the prof, so hopefully this will be solved soon.
	(I think it might be because partners are working on newer versions of java)
